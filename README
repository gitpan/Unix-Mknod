Unix-Mknod version 0.02
=======================

This module allows access to the device routines major()/minor()/makedev()
that may or may not be macros in .h files.

It also allows access to the mknod system call.

NOTES

There are 2 other perl modules that implement the mknod(2) system call,
but they have problems working on some platforms.  Sys::Mknod does not
work on AIX because it uses the syscall(2) generic system call which
AIX does not have.  Mknod implements S_IFIFO, which on most platforms
is not implemented in mknod, but rather mkfifo (which is implemented
in POSIX perl module).

The perl module File::Stat::Bits also implements major() and minor() (and
a version of makedev() called dev_join).  They are done as a program to
get the bit masks at compile time, but if major() and minor() are
implemented as sub routines, the arugment could be something as simple
as an index to a lookup table (and thereby having no decernable relation
to its result).
